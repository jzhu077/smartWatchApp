        <h4> Junyu Zhu (zhu908@student.otago.ac.nz , ): </h4>
         <p> I have experiences with everything apart from SVG from COMP212 (Website Design paper) and a few websites I created during my free time 
             for fun. In addition to that, I coded all my etudes of COSC326 in JavaScript. </p>

        <h4> Alycia Ng (alycia_nse@hotmail.com , 8170944): </h4>
         <p> This is the first time I've encountered HTML5, SVG, CSS and JavaScript but I have been learning from online tutorials on how to code in 
             those languages. I will learn along the way as the project progresses. I have a good grasp on English and I am quite comfortable to edit
             and proofread any reports and documents. </p>
   
        <h4> Ana Baltazar (anafrancinebaltazar@gmail.com , 7002399): </h4>
         <p> I have learned Javascript, HTML5 and CSS from the COMP212 website design paper. I do not know much about SVG and the &lt;canvas&gt; element. 
             My strengths are knowing Javascript and HTML5 beforehand and my weaknesses are learning new languages slowly. </p>

        <h4> Jialin Yang (garinyang@gmail.com , 7674607): </h4>
	 <p> I have had some experience with JavaScript and HTML. I have maintained an embedded system that ran a mini-httpd server before. However,
             English is not my first language. </p>

   <h2> Description of SmartWatch Application</h2>

	<p> Our team will be making a travel app that is based in Dunedin that is easy and simple to use is the prototype we are intending to build. 
             The app will have a search filter to look for the nearest entertainment, restaurants, transport and 
             restrooms close to you and restricted to Dunedin only. This can be done by integrating Google Maps into the
             travel app. </p>

        <p> The app will allow the user to pick a radius from their current location. From the radius chosen, the app will produce a list of places to dine, 
             sight-see, or rest depending on the user's needs. For example, if the user wants to locate nearby restaurants closest to their location, the app 
             will generate the smallest radius possible and suggest possible restaurants around the user within that radius. If the user has no restriction on
             time or distance, then a bigger radius can be provided and more suggestions will be generated by the app. </p>
	
	<p> The second option available to the user would be to choose from a category of food, activities, accommodation and public facilities. After the user 
             chooses a category, they can sort the available options by popularity or distance. This will influence their choice and help in decision-making. These
             two options would show the distance to the destination. </p>
 
        <p> Lastly, the choices made by the user will be saved in an itinerary which the user can view and edit at any time. </p>

        <p> Emulator: </p>

     <ul>
        <li>Storing and providing longitude and latitude values to the app</li>
        <li>Handling error messages</li>
        <li>Handles display and user input</li>
     </ul>

        <p> App: </p>
  
     <ul>
        <li>Displays the longitude and latitude values provided by the emulator</li>
        <li>Displays error messages provided by the emulator</li>
     </ul>

   	<p> The app has several functions such as GPS location services that can be provided by the emulator itself. JavaScript provides several functions that 
            returns the user's location values. The emulator can store this information and provide it to the travel app if it needs those values. The app itself
            will ask for the user's permission to allow GPS location. </p>

   <section id = "version_control_system">
   <h2> Version Control System </h2>

        <p> The team will be using Github platform for version control of our Smartwatch application. Github can store our codes on the internet server, which enables
            team members to share their work. One member could edit the file, upload it to Github, and another member could continue their partner's work without 
            waiting for the attendance of other members. Thus, everyone will be able to work according to their own schedule while working on the project. In addition,
            Github can track changes and keep all the version of the project. This feature is extremely significant and important to our software development. For 
            instance, if some bugs seem difficult to fix, it will then be possible to trace back to an older working version of the code and compare for differences and
            similarities. Furthermore, Github keeps a record of reasons for changes when they occur as well as the user who made the change. Therefore it is possible to 
            discuss with the right person for specific parts of the code and reduce cost of communication when problems arise.  </p>

        <p> Github also allows users to download and edit the programs without interfering with other team members' work. This contrasts to a program like Google Docs
            which allows users to simultaneously edit reports. These features of Github allows a team to manage their project wisely. Moreover, it is easy to learn and
            use on multiple platforms. </p>

   <section id = "programming_language">
   <h2> Programming Language </h2>

        <p> <b>Javascript</b> is a language that is very lenient towards variable declaration. This may lead to program inconsistencies and confusion especially for a program 
            that will be developed by several people. </p>

        <p> <b>Jquery</b> is a programming package or tool or library that the team can use on top of plain Javascript. It can convert Javascript to more concise and more 
            understandable. Plain Javascript by itself is dense and difficult to read. Moreover, it can hide and simplify implementation of difficult processes such as 
            ajax. However, since half of the team members do not know Javascript that well, it might be a long and slow learning curve. The time it takes for the members
            to learn Javascript can be used to develp the app itself. Therefore by choosing to use Jquery, there might be a possibility for the time to be used inefficiently.
            However, Jquery is efficient to use if one would need to manipulate the document object model, DOM of the program. The app and emulator that we are going to develop
            will not be needing DOM scripting. Thus, it would not be a huge loss to the development process if we chose not to use Jquery. </p>

        <p> <b>Typescript</b> is another development tool that the team can use to develop the emulator and app. Typescript has modules available which stringently checks for variable
            declaration. Therefore by using Typescript, there may be potential for users to not be confused and produce inconsistencies in the program. Inconsistencies appear
            because Javascript is a weakly typed language that will keep 'guessing' the type of variable for you. Eventually, these 'guesses' lead to errors which then lead to 
            inconsistencies in the program. Therefore, our team will be using Typescript since two out of four team members are not familiar with Javascript. It will be easier to
            produce an application and an emulator using Typescript given the timeframe. Also, given that most of the team members have a strong background in object-oriented
            programming, Typescript will be a good fit for all. </p>

   <section id = "editor_type">
   <h2> The Editor </h2>

       <p> We will be using webstorm because the IDE provides support for JavaScript, Node.js, CSS and HTML. There are four Webstorm features: </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><b> Intelligent Coding Assistance: </b></li>
              Webstorm has coding assistance for JavaScript, CSS and HTML. This feature autocompletes Javascript keywords, variables, methods, functions and parameters.
      <li><b> Debugging, Tracing and Testing: </b></li>
              Webstorm has breakpoint feature that will be very useful for our debugging stages. It allows for specific points in the code to be individually inspected and analyzed. 
              For example, any logical statements and expressions can be tracked in the specific portion of code and be analyzed.
      <li><b> Seamless Tool Integration: </b></li>
              Supports CSS Custom Properties. 
      <li><b> IDE Features: </b></li>
              Webstorm has a unified UI  for working with Git which is the version control system that we are using. In comparison, Eclipse, Bluefish and Brackets does not have this 
              feature. This feature however is important to our group project and having this feature would be very invaluable for our project. 
      <li> Webstorm also has a version control system for local changes. It keeps track of any changes over time as one develops program code. </li>
      <li> Webstorm supports TypeScript integration. It recognizes TypeScript files and allows the programmer to edit these files. This feature is useful as we will be using TypeScript
           for this project. </li>  
    </ol>

      <p> There are other editors such as Brackets and Bluefish which are very simple text editors and in comparison to Webstorm, these two editors are very fast and easy to use. However, 
          these two strengths are not what we require to build our smartwatch app and emulator. Furthermore, we would need to import and install modules and functions to obtain features 
          such as debugging and tracing. </p>

      <p> Eclipse IDE has all the features listed above but with extra features that are too bulky and cumbersome to use for a small project like ours. The Eclipse IDE is a good web editor
          but having those complex features mean it will take more time to start up on a cheap laptop. As students who have limited budgets and can't afford MAC computers available at OWHEO 
          building, it would not be practical to use Eclipse IDE. Overall, we might waste time waiting for Eclipse to load and compile programs. Another IDE that we can chose Webstorm over, 
          was Netbeans IDE. Netbeans has almost all the features that Webstorm has, i.e. good live editing support, except for one particular feature - Refactoring in JavaScript/JQuery. </p>
   
   <section id = "debugging_tools">    
   <h2> Debugging Tools </h2>

       <p> There are two very good debugging tools available - Firebug and Google Chrome's Dev tools. Both debugging tools offer breakpoints, live tracing, error messages and the ability to watch 
           variables. </p>
   
       <p> Chrome's Dev Tools offer features such as saving small scripts (using JavaScript snippets), breakpoint, and provides a console panel for diagnose and log. Although not essential, Chrome
           offers a way to make JavaScript look 'pretty'. For example, Chrome's debugging tool enables developers to display log messages or variables at any point in time. In contrast, Firebug has 
           a step-by-step debugging feature that is easier to understand and manipulate when compared to Chrome's debugging tool. With Firebug, we are able to edit HTML live and find errors immediately
           with detailed information about the errors. Firebug also finds DOM (Document Object Model) quickly and allows us to edit as we go. Also, it has powerful logging functions that we can call 
           from our webpages. Finally, Firebug provides users with easy access, i.e. it can be opened in a different window or simply as a bar at the bottom of the browser. In conclusion, our choice to 
           use Firebug is mainly down to personal preference. </p>

       <p> For our project, we are going to use the breakpoint feature offered in google chrome. This feature is also available in Webstorm and Netbeans IDE. Both Brackets and Bluefish only support JSLint
           as its debugging feature. In comparison, Webstorm supports JSLint and JSHint. However for our project, we will need to have more in-depth debugging tools. For example, we will need to have a 
           breakpoint feature so that we can see what is going on in the specific part of the code. Both Webstorm and Netbeans IDE have this feature which allow users to have breakpoints in the code to
           watch and track changes to variables and expressions. The debugging tools of Brackets and Bluefish are still under development, which means they may not meet our demands.  Netbeans provides 
           breakpoints and variables monitor that help us to debug deeper. As does eclipse, which includes both firebug and chrome DevTool as extensions. </p>
 
       <p> JSLint and JSHint are both bundled into Webstorm, which is our IDE of choice.  They both look for errors in the code e.g. checks syntax errors. JSLint allows for good JavaScript practice. 
           Therefore we can code and debug more efficiently. JSHint also gives suggestions for better coding e.g. remove an unused variable. It also provides debugging similar to JSLint but in a kinder 
           format. JSLint is an extremely strict debugging tool and is very picky i.e. has a lot of rules in terms of coding style which should be the developer's choice. Some examples are, JSLint doesn't 
           allow for 'for-loops' (but we can override that feature) and only a certain number of spaces are allowed. </p>

       <p> We conclude that using WebStorm can optimise debugging efforts by having two debuggers present in WebStorm. Also, there is no need to visit JSLint.com or JSHint.com websites to load JavaScript 
           files and run debugging processes through that. This would save the team from wasting any unnecessary time. </p>

            <ul>
              <li> 21st - Meet up and discuss the app and assignment specifications </li>
            </ul>

     <p><b> APRIL </b></p>
  
            <ul>
              <li> 4th - Discuss the type of app and split the assignment into four. 
                         At least 4 hours to plan and discuss </li>
              <li> 10th - Finish and write research with group members. Aim for at 
                          least 90% finish with research report and planning. Take 
                          at least 4 - 5 hours to plan and research together. Junyu 
                          and Ana will plan how to partition work between the emulator 
                          and prototype. Alycia and Frank will finish the debugging 
                          section of the report and Github question. Aim for at least 
                          95% finish in the four hours allocated to the meeting. </li>
             <li> 13th - Proofread and review report. Each individual will do this in 
                         their own time. </li>
             <li><b> 14th - Assignment 1 due </b></li>
             <li> 15th-19th - Rest break. However, each person can also allocate at least
                              30 minutes to review and research on how to implement the
                              travel app such as how to implement Databases and JavaScript
                              needed. Also, each person would need to learn how to use 
                              TypeScript in their own time during their rest period. </li>
             <li> 25th - Start using Github version to develop and code program. Junyu and
                         Frank will start developing the emulator. Unit testing for this part 
                         would also be implemented and developed. It is not expected that the 
                         emulator would be finished in this time period but time would be spent
                         learning and implementing JavaScript code to be 70-80% functional. Ana,
                         Junyu, and Alycia will start working on the Travel App itself. The full 
                         4 hours of the group meeting would be spent implementing JavaScript code
                         to design the Travel App and make it at least 30% functional. </li>
            </ul>
